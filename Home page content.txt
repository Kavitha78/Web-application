We set out to provide easily accessible hearing and sight tests for rural populations in 
India who have limited access to medical care. The idea was that by making a lightweight, 
front-end only application it could be taken by health groups into rural areas without needing 
expensive equipment or having people come to cities to be tested. This is not the first test of 
this kind, but it is the first to be translated into Hindi, Kannada, Telugu, and Tamil so that it's 
easily accessible to the people living in the rural areas of India. 


Testing Idea
	 
The three things we made tests for are color blindness, hearing loss, and hearing 
sensitivity to different frequencies. These are a few of the most common problems people may 
have with seeing and hearing, and helping people diagnose issues can dramatically improve 
their quality of life. Each test we made was based on existing medical tests for the same issue.
