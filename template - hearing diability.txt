			"Hearing impairment is an impairment in hearing, whether permanent or fluctuating and occurs when you lose part or all of your ability to hear. 
                         Hearing impairments are classified in terms of the severity and type of hearing impairment.

                         "Why would I need a hearing test? Some people may suspect that they have hearing loss. They have trouble hearing people talk to them when they’re 
                          in a crowded room, or they’ve been told they raise the volume on the TV way too high.But not all people know that they have a problem. You may not 
                          realize that you have hearing loss, because it’s often a gradual process. That’s why it’s important to have your ears checked when your doctor says
                          you should, even if you think you’re fine.

                          hearing test is to pinpoint your hearing challenges. By testing your ability to hear messages in noisy environments and high frequency sounds, we will 
                          be able to determine whether or not you should consult a hearing care professional.

                          This test is a self-assessment tool to measure hearing difficulties and problems. This test is for informational purposes only. If you believe you may have a 
                          hearing impairment please consult an ENT Doctor or Otolaryngologist. Results may vary depending on many factors including the type and quality of your device
                          display and the noise in your surroundings. 

                          Before taking this online test you should:

                          Set up somewhere quiet - a loud and busy room will make it much harder to hear properly and get accurate results
                          Decide between speakers or headphones - we recommend headphones, as these will test your right and left ears individually
                          Turn the volume to a level where it’s comfortable for you

                          Once you’re relaxed and confident in your surroundings, feel free to begin.

                          Conductive hearing loss is when a hearing impairment is due to problems in the outer ear, middle ear, ear canal, eardrum, or the ossicles, which are 
                          the tiny bones in the middle ear. When the sound is not being conducted properly through the ear, conductive hearing loss occurs. Most cases of 
                          conductive hearing loss can be corrected medically or surgically.

			  Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), also referred to as nerve hearing loss, occurs when there is damage to either the auditory nerve or the cochlea, 
                          which is the inner ear. The hearing loss in SNHL is permanent, although it may be possible to treat it with hearing aids.

			  Mixed heaing loss is when When conductive hearing loss and SNHL occur at the same time. Mixed hearing loss occurs when there is both damage to the outer 
                          or middle ear and damage to the inner ear.

		          Central hearing loss occurs when there are problems within the brain that interfere with the ability to interpret or understand sounds. This is the rarest 
                          type of hearing impairment and the hardest to treat.
